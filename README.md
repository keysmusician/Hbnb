## About
Hbnb is a web application designed to mimic Airbnb. In this final version, I extended the project to try to recreate the feel of Airbnb's current web experience. The project was divided into 7 parts:
1. The Console
2. Web Static
3. Database
4. Deploy Static
5. Web Framework
6. REST API
7. Web Dynamic

### Technologies
This project was developed with the following tools:
* **Environment**: Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)
* **Application Codebase**: Python 3.4.3
  * **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 1.2.5
  * **Database connector**: MySQLdb/mysqlclient 2.0.3
  	* Greenlet 1.1.1
  * **Web Framework**: Flask 1.0.4
  	* Flask-CORSs 3.0.10

* **Web stack**
	* HTML5
	* CSS3
	* JavaScript 1.7
		* jQuery 3.2.1

## Installation
To try any part of this project yourself:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/keysmusician/Hbnb`
2. Install necessary dependencies:
	* Fabric
	* Flasgger
	* Flask
	* Flask-CORS
	* Greenlet
	* MySQL
	* MySQLdb/mysqlclient
	* Python3
	* SQLAlchemy

	*Note: Not all dependencies are needed for every section of this project.*

3. Change directory: `cd Hbnb`

3. To use the database storage engine:
	* Set up the development database: `cat ./setup_mysql_dev.sql | mysql -root -p`
	* Set the environment variables for development: `HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db`
4. To run the database storage tests:
	* set up the test database: `cat ./setup_mysql_test.sql | mysql -root -p`
	* Set the environment variables for testing: `HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db`

## The Console
The Console was the first stage of the project. In this stage, we wrote classes for representing users and listings, a file storage engine for saving and recalling data between interactive sessions, as well as a command interpreter (the console proper), Hbnb CLI, for easily managing our data. The Hbnb CLI provides a backend interface to our storage engine(s).

### Hbnb CLI
The Hbnb CLI (command line interpreter) provides a convenient command line interface specifically to manage (add, delete, modify, etc.) Hbnb data.
It offers an improved workflow over alternatives such as embedding data into source code, manually managing a data file, or using the Python interpreter to manage the data.

### Commands
*Bracketed arguments are optional.*
* `all [CLASS]` - Show all objects.
* `create CLASS` - Create a new object.
* `destroy CLASS ID` - Destroy a specified instance.
* `help [COMMAND]` - Get information about a command.
* `quit` - Close an interactive session. Also quit with `^-D` or `EOF`.
* `show CLASS ID` - Display a single instance.
* `update CLASS ID ATTRIBUTE VALUE` - Edit attributes of an instance.

### Usage
Start an interactive Hbnb CLI session by executing `console.py`:

`./console.py`

If it runs successfully, it will display the prompt and await input:

`(hbnb) `

Simply type any valid command(s) listed above. Type `quit` to exit the interactive session.

The Hbnb CLI may also be used non-non-interactively by piping input to it from a shell:

`$ echo "help" | ./console.py`


### Examples
```
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) create Place
aba364fd-8b9e-4c4b-b865-8db6a6e9bc03

(hbnb) all
["[Place] (aba364fd-8b9e-4c4b-b865-8db6a6e9bc03) {'created_at': datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 1, 13, 29, 27, 264673), 'id': 'aba364fd-8b9e-4c4b-b865-8db6a6e9bc03', 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 1, 13, 29, 27, 264832)}"]
(hbnb)
```

## Web Static
The Web Static part of this project consisted of designing the website HTML and CSS.

## Database
In the Database stage, we built a second storage engine: database storage. This engine uses a MySQL database and SQLAlchemy to manage data persistence. We introduced the following environment variables:
* `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`
* `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`
* `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`
* `HBNB_MYSQL_DB`
* `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE`

If `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE` = `db`, the database storage engine will be used. The values of the other environment variables are used to establish a connection to a MySQL database. Consequently, the specified database must exist *and* contain the expected tables.
Both storage engines' classes have the same methods implemented to provide seamless toggling between them. The SQLAlchemy ORM required significant additions to our models in order to properly link them to a database.

`setup_mysql_dev.sql` sets up a development environment database and user. Use the following environment variables to use the development environment:
```HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db```

`setup_mysql_test.sql` sets up a test database and user. Use this database and user when running tests.
Use the following environment variables to use the test environment:
```HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db```

## Deploy Static
In this stage, we set up an Nginx web server and deployed our static files using Fabricâ€”at least, that was the plan...

## Web Framework
In the Web Framework stage we created a dynamic web application using Flask as our frontend application framework. We learned how to set up routes in Flask and create Jinja templates. That allowed us to create dynamic HTML using data pulled from our MySQL database.

The following environment variables determine the host and port the development server will use:
* `HBNB_FRONTEND_HOST`
* `HBNB_FRONTEND_PORT`

The recommended way to serve the frontend locally is to launch Flask's development server with `FLASK_APP=frontend/hbnb.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run`. By default, Flask binds to `localhost:5000`. You may specify a host and port or use the environment variables described above with `FLASK_APP=web_flask/hbnb.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run --host="$HBNB_FRONTEND_HOST" --port "$HBNB_FRONTEND_PORT"`.

Alternatively, the server may be launched from the *root* directory of this repository with `python3 -m web_flask.hbnb`. Unless specified in the environment variables, the host and port default to `0.0.0.0` and `5001` respectively.

Notes on launching the web application server: 
- Executing with `./web_flask/hbnb.py` will not use your virtual environment's version of python. In addition:

- Executing with a python interpreter and path (relative or absolute) such as `python ./web_flask/hbnb.py` won't work because the modules being imported won't be found. `hbnb.py` needs to be imported as a module from the root of the project directory.


## REST API
In this section of the project, we built a REST API. Our Flask blueprint and views for the API can be found in the `api` directory. Our API base URL is `<host>/api/v1/`.

### Usage
Note that for the purposes of this project, we hosted locally with the built in development server that comes with Flask. The following environment variables determine the host and port the development server will use:
* `HBNB_API_HOST`
* `HBNB_API_PORT`

Unless specified, the host and port default to `0.0.0.0` and `5002` respectively.
To try this API yourself, follow the [installation](#installation) steps, launch our API on the Flask development server, and go to `http://0.0.0.0:5002/api/v1/<endpoint>`. A successful request returns JSON.

### Example
Running the development server:
```
$ python3 -m api.v1.app
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
. . .
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5002/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
Requesting an endpoint:
```
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:5002/api/v1/stats
{
  "amenities": 1,
  "cities": 1,
  "places": 1,
  "reviews": 1,
  "states": 1,
  "users": 1
}
```


### Endpoints
The following are the endpoints we defined and their corresponding supported HTTP methods:
|Endpoint|Methods|
|--------|-------|
|`/amenities/`| GET, POST |
|`/amenities/<amenity_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |
|`/cities/<city_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |
|`/cities/<city_id>/places`|  GET, POST |
|`/places/<place_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |
|`/places/<place_id>/reviews`| GET, POST |
|`/reviews/<review_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |
|`/states/`| GET, POST |
|`/states/<state_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |
|`/states/<state_id>/cities`|  GET, POST |
|`/status`| GET |
|`/summary` *| GET |
|`/users/`| GET, POST |
|`/users/<user_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |

\* Renamed from `/stats` in the Holberton School project.

## Web Dynamic
In this final phase of the project, we wrote jQuery scripts which dynamically update portions of the website. We added:

* An API status indicator
* Dynamic display of selected amenities
* Frontend requests to the API for search results
* Dynamically updated HTML based on the APIâ€™s response

Because the HTML is now being dynamically updated client-side, the frontend Flask application server is no longer strictly necessary; The frontend could be written entirely in JavaScript. However, the server provides the advantage of ensuring the initial landing page load is fast and pre-rendered, as well as search engine optimized, since bots, which typically don't execute JavaScript, would not be able to parse the full page it if was rendered client-side. One drawback is that it creates redundancy, because any changes to the results section of the home page's Jinja template would require an equivalent change on the client-side (in the JavaScript which modifies the DOM after a search). The same code has to be written twice: in Jinja, and in JavaScript. However, while it violates the DRY principle, I have opted to keep the frontend application server for the given reasons.

## Application Architecture
Holberton School allowed us three host devices for use in deploying our Airbnb clones. Using these hosts, we configured our application architecture as an internet-facing load balancer in front of a primary-replica pair.

![Application architecture diagram initially used for Hbnb](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEUjfMSGtLib6nmreaoqJZDLWYMDaaIB2dOiPXc_dKd9KYhgwNcmp4_5Gdf4w5vzS_-nXrrp9zNo9v0iwSXbOra4BTYoJRDYTHwxknnXgfVktDyaLnxrHIVDdQmQUtuCmqNn2wYeuYgR95LamaQElwk_qA=w2164-h1364-no)

Our servers were complete with firewalls, monitoring, TLS/SSL, production-grade web and application servers, and database synchronization. 

Our access to those hosts has since expired, so I have now deployed the project on [Fly.io](fly.io), but with a simplified application architecture (due to the limitations of Fly's free tier). I am running the entire application in a single Docker container. I'm still using Nginx for my web server and Gunicorn for my application servers. TLS/SSL is handled by Fly. Nginx proxies requests between the internet and the two Gunicorn application servers for the frontend and API.

## What's Next?
There are a few steps I plan to take to improve this project:

- Currently, the deployed version uses the file storage engine. I'd like to switch over to the database storage engine when it is ready. 

- Add a firewall to the Docker container running the application.

- Add ratings to rooms

- Improve the styling and content of rooms and 404 pages

- Implement a solution which provides a single place to write frontend templates to avoid duplicate code in both Jinja and JavaScript.

Additionally, to feel more like Airbnb does today, it would be nice to have:

- Images of places

- Room categories/tags and respective filter

- User management
