## Installation
To try any part of this project yourself, follow these instructions:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/keysmusician/AirBnB_clone_v3.git`
2. Install necessary dependencies:
	* Fabric
	* Flasgger
	* Flask
	* Flask-CORS
	* MySQL
	* MySQLdb/mysqlclient
	* Python3
	* SQLAlchemy

	*Note: Not all dependencies are needed for every section of this project.*

3. Change directory: `cd AirBnB_clone_v4`

3. If you'd like to use the database storage engine:
	* Set up the development database: `cat ./setup_mysql_dev.sql | mysql -root -p`
	* Set the environment variables for development: `HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db`
4. If you'd like to run the database storage tests:
	* set up the test database: `cat ./setup_mysql_test.sql | mysql -root -p`
	* Set the environment variables for testing: `HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db`

## The Console
The Console is the first stage of the HBnB clone. In it, we wrote classes for representing users and listings, a file storage engine for saving and recalling data between interactive sessions, as well as a command interpreter (the console), for easily managing our data. The console provides a backend interface to our storage engine(s).

### HBnB CLI — The command interpreter
The HBnB CLI (command line interpreter) provides a convenient command line interface specifically to manage (add, delete, modify, etc.) HBnB data.
It offers an improved workflow over alternatives such as embedding data in the source code, manually managing a data file, or using the Python interpreter to manage the data.

### Commands
Bracketed arguments are optional.
* `all [CLASS]` - Show all objects.
* `create CLASS` - Create a new object.
* `destroy CLASS ID` - Destroy a specified instance.
* `help [COMMAND]` - Get information about a command.
* `quit` - Close an interactive session. Also quit with `^-D` or `EOF`.
* `show CLASS ID` - Display a single instance.
* `update CLASS ID ATTRIBUTE VALUE` - Edit attributes of an instance.

### Usage
Start an interactive HBnB CLI session by executing `console.py`:

`./console.py`

If it runs successfully, it will display the prompt and await input:

`(hbnb) `

Simply type any valid command(s) listed above. Type `quit` to exit the interactive session.

The HBnB CLI may also be used non-non-interactively by piping input to it from a shell:

`$ echo "help" | ./console.py`


### Examples
```
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) create Place
aba364fd-8b9e-4c4b-b865-8db6a6e9bc03

(hbnb) all
["[Place] (aba364fd-8b9e-4c4b-b865-8db6a6e9bc03) {'created_at': datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 1, 13, 29, 27, 264673), 'id': 'aba364fd-8b9e-4c4b-b865-8db6a6e9bc03', 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 1, 13, 29, 27, 264832)}"]
(hbnb)
```

## Web Static
The Web Static part of this project consisted of designing the website HTML and CSS.

## Database
In the Database stage, we built a second storage engine: database storage. This engine uses a MySQL database and SQLAlchemy to manage data persistence. We introduced the following environment variables:
* `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`
* `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`
* `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`
* `HBNB_MYSQL_DB`
* `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE`

If `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE` = `db`, the database storage engine will be used. The values of the other environment variables are used to establish a connection to a MySQL database. Consequently, the specified database must exist *and* contain the expected tables.
Both storage engines' classes have the same methods implemented to provide seamless toggling between them. The SQLAlchemy ORM required significant additions to our models in order to properly link them to a database.

`setup_mysql_dev.sql` sets up a development environment database and user. Use the following environmant variables to use the developent environment:
```HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db```

`setup_mysql_test.sql` sets up a test database and user. Use this database and user when running tests.
Use the following environmant variables to use the test environment:
```HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db```

## Deploy Static
In this stage, we set up an Nginx web server and deployed our static files using Fabric—at least, that was the plan...

## Web Framework
In the Web Framework stage we learned how to set up routes in Flask and create Jinja templates. That allowed us to create dynamic HTML using data pulled from our MySQL database.

## REST API
In this section of the project, we built a REST API. Our Flask blueprint and views for the API can be found in the `api` directory. Our API base URL is `<host>/api/v1/`.

### Usage
Note that for the purposes of this project, we hosted locally with the built in development server that comes with Flask. The following environment variables determine the host and port the development server will use:
* `HBNB_API_HOST`
* `HBNB_API_PORT`

Unless specified, the host and port default to `0.0.0.0` and `5000` respectively.
To try this API yourself, follow the [installation](#installation) steps, launch our API on the Flask development server, and go to `http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/<endpoint>`. A successful request returns JSON.

### Example
Running the development server:
```
$ python3 -m api.v1.app
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
. . .
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
Requesting an endpoint:
```
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/stats
{
  "amenities": 1,
  "cities": 1,
  "places": 1,
  "reviews": 1,
  "states": 1,
  "users": 1
}
```


### Endpoints
The following are the endpoints we defined and their corresponding supported HTTP methods:
|Endpoint|Methods|
|--------|-------|
|`/amenities/`| GET, POST |
|`/amenities/<amenity_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |
|`/cities/<city_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |
|`/cities/<city_id>/places`|  GET, POST |
|`/places/<place_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |
|`/places/<place_id>/reviews`| GET, POST |
|`/reviews/<review_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |
|`/states/<state_id>/cities`|  GET, POST |
|`/stats`| GET |
|`/states/`| GET, POST |
|`/states/<state_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |
|`/status`| GET |
|`/users/`| GET, POST |
|`/users/<user_id>`| DELETE, GET, PUT |

## Web Dynamic
In this final phase of the project, we wrote jQuery scripts
