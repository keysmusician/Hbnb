 * The API's root URL when in a development environment. It will be different
 * in development than in production. Set this to the API server's host and
 * port. //TODO: Automate this.
 **/
// Hosted via Docker:
// export const API_root = 'http://localhost:8000/api/'

// Hosted via Flask development server (make sure the port matches):
export const API_root = 'http://localhost:5002/api/v1/'
