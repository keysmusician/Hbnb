I was greeted by their pups and barking, but don't be afraid they're actually really sweet. <br>Although the idea of having your room accessed by others may be a turn off it wasn't that awkward hahaha<br>In your bedroom they provide a curtain with the bed for extra privacy. It really does make your stay more comfortable and is a very nice detail that helped me sleep more comfortably at night. s a very urban and photogenic area. THANK YOU KATIE AND MATTHIJS ! ",

Jim suggested Weidmann's, a really great restaurant nearby (sit on the balcony in the balcony bar!) that has been there since 1870!, and it didn't disappoint. The room is pretty stunning and much bigger than the photos show. You basically have a whole, private wing of the house, including a bedroom, living room (with a daybed separate from the bedroom), private bathroom, and kitchenette. All to yourself!

Despite this, the owner, Michelle, waited up for us so that she could welcome us as we arrived and insisted that we text her if we needed anything. Throughout the week, she asked about our trip and told us about great places to see and things to do in the area (including the best local farmers' market EVER).  One night, when we were laughing like hyenas, Michelle thought we'd seen a roach and came running out to SAVE US!  We never did figure out who \"Barbara\" is, but we really hope Michelle isn't paying her to find guests for her place.  Barbara comes across as very curt (we never met her, though, so we can't say for sure if this is truly her personality; we all know it's tough to gauge a person's tone online).  So, if you're considering staying here but are put off a bit by Barbara",

I gad to call to get directions and my host, Jason, was so nice and guided me there in a snap!  Once I got there though I realized how great the location is. Its very close to all the fun of downtown Lafayette but far enough to not have to deal with the noise of everything once you want to settle down for the night.  The airstream itself was very nice and clean with amenities such as tea, Luna bars, and beer provided (in my case, strawberry beer ) as well as shampoo and conditioner and nice towels.  I am 5'6 on a good day and this place was the perfect ceiling height for me (about 1ft- 1 1/2 ft above my head. It seemed spacious and bright in the morning too. I had an excellent time in Lafayette but my time here was definitely the best part.",

Don't let this turn you away. Once inside you'll be taken in by the view and the very cool interior decoration. Jim collects vintage furnishings and he and Maki have decorated the interior in an attractive and artful manner.\n<br>\n<br>Of course, it's the hosts that make or break a stay at an AirBnB. Maki and Jim made us feel right at home. Maki makes delicious and creative breakfasts. \n<br>\n<br>Keep in mind that you're not right in a town. The nearest Starbucks is a  5 to 10 minute drive.  One of the features we liked was that most everything we wanted to see or do was within 30 minutes. On the other hand, depending on how you look at it, everything is at least 30 minutes away. No problem for us.",

		"text": "We rented this place because we were attending a funeral in Birmingham. It was really the closest to Birmingham we could find in our price range and that wouldn't be out of the way for the interment, which was in Montevallo. If we were only going to be in Birmingham, it was a bit far. But if you're travelling to Montevallo for any reason, this place is perfect. It's tucked away up on a wooded hill and there is a lot of space. It was just the two of us and we could have brought the entire family (not that we wanted to do that). The place is furnished well and there are coffee supplies and bottled water in the kitchen. It was cold the two nights we were there and the furnace seems to heat a bit unevenly but there are a couple of space heaters which made up for that quite nicely and my husband and I were warm. We had a little trouble deciding on our sleeping arrangements - the first night we slept separately in the two ground level bedrooms which have full size beds, and the second night ",

The studio is exquisite: it's decorated very well and has far more amenities than some 5-star hotels I've stayed in. The infrared sauna was a treat; nothing like sweating out the toxins after traveling all day! And then there's the amazing shower (and yes, there's a deep, jetted tub for those of you who prefer long baths). He offered many toiletries for my use, even Origins masks, which I splurged on and used two. The bed was comfortable and the rugs that are on the floor are nice and soft; bring slippers or socks if you get cold feet, though, as most of the floors are not carpeted. The Nespresso machine was a treat (I could even make my own foam for a cappucino!) and Randall left snacks and drinks in the fridge. If you're looking for a ..",

The room feels very private and cozy with a luxurious bed and sleek bathroom. They thought of absolutely everything and more - from extra toiletries, bottled water, and a wine fridge to 2 for 1 winery coupons. Free coffee and tea. The jacuzzi tub was a perfect way to relax after a day of wine tasting. Downtown is a 5 minute drive away and all the wineries are an easy, beautiful drive. Deb and Doug were available for anything we needed yet respected our privacy. We had a great time getting to know them and their adorable kitties. ",

We didn't have electricity on the second day and couldn't use any of the kitchen appliances to prepare food. The road into the ranch crosses a riverbed, and you will want to have a high-clearance vehicle during and after inclement weather (and maybe at other times as well; we were there during a rainy spell). There is plenty of opportunity to spend time outside, but we didn't find a terribly conducive spot. It's difficult to move through the river bottom near the ranch, so hiking is somewhat limited except along the road. Lots of wildlife though and definitely a quiet place to pause and reflect.  ",

Even though the cottage is located in a pretty adjoining garden to the back of the house, it felt very private. There\u2019s even a small secluded patio near the cottage entrance that would be lovely to use in nice weather. I also appreciated that the main house was decorated with little white lights \u2013 that made it easy to identify where to turn when coming back in the dark.

We cooked  meals and enjoyed the house as much as our busy scheduled allowed. Jim's house is going to be a real winner on airbnb. I was coaching 8 other families who all over paid for hotels in Meridian and when they saw the room my family had they were extremely jealous. I've stayed in Airbnb's all over the world as a professional tennis coach and this was by far the most historic and unique stay I've had. It was also my wife's first stay in an airbnb and she was a little apprehensive at first. It took no time for her to get hooked. Glad to know when we travel as a family all of us will pick airbnb!

Frank and Naomi gave us detailed directions and advice on how to navigate the very tight streets leading up to the house (they don't show up on GPS). Frank was there to greet us and guide us into the parking area (where the car sat untouched for the remainder of the stay), and show us around the house. Naomi called a bit later to make sure all was well. Once settled in we found the house to be very clean, cozy and inviting. While this is a 100+ year old house, it appears to have been renovated recently. Plenty of room in the dresser and closet to unpack. The office sized water cooler was a thoughtful amenity in a dry climate. We loved getting up in the morning, making a pot of coffee (great local roast provided), and enjoying a cup or two on the front porch, in the sun, overlooking the town and the view beyond. The downtown is a short walk from the house, either directly down the stairs, or down the road. As ",

Maki's breakfast was perfectly fit for us and really yummy. She cooks only using organic vegis, which makes us healthy in the morning. One day, we got together. Jim let me know how I can cook his secret Steak that was fantastic flavor with red wine. I will never forget our staying with them. If anyone would like to stay in O'ahu island, I will definitely recommend Jim&Maki's house ! Their house is located in the center of island, which is very convenient to drive to any place in the island. The house and room are exactly the same as in photo. We have no problems with laundary, shower, cooking, and so on. Neiborhood is very quite, so that we sleep deeply. Thank U Jim and Maki ! ",

This is a bit more than a 1Br/1Ba because the place is outfitted with everything you could want for a short stay (mini fridge, keureg, microwave, toaster oven, and water cooler) and there are TWO step out balconies, one of which is nice and sunny in the morning; so my gf and I enjoyed doing a quick breakfast there before heading out to wineries or wherever. We ended up driving the ~1 mile into downtown Napa the night we did go check it out, but you def could walk. The property is set in a really quiet little suburban section, so very peaceful at night and pretty stars too. We'll totally go back.",

We were very impressed with the small details in the cottage such as a welcome basket with treats and a sweet note, a plethora of fresh towels, updated amenities, and a list of recommendations in the area. We arrived later in the evening - Easy check in was a breeze! The location is great and within a quick distance to the Plaza, Glen Ellen, and only 40 minutes to Napa. We had no issues, but Melanie was just a quick text away. We had such a great experience and will definitely be back. Thank you Melanie for the wonderful getaway in wine country!!",

Located in Beaverton, just a short drive from downtown and the airport, it was a quiet escape nestled on the end of the street in a nice neighborhood. We rented a car, so the drive downtown was super quick and easy but there is public transit as well. The house itself was perfect for us because we like to cook, so the kitchen had everything (and more) that we needed to whip up a meal. There are tons of games and cards to play during a fun night in front of the cozy fireplace. Also, the bed was the most comfortable we've ever slept on, even more than our bed back home. It's not often you stay in an airbnb and think, 'gosh, I wish this were my home.' We would highly recommend Naomi's place to anyone looking for a cozy getaway in a beautiful city.",

		"text": "Kathleen's home is in a nice suburban area of Naperville, only about a mile from the downtown area. Kathleen herself is a fantastic hostess and was very easygoing about our stay. We had an odd check-out time (which was one of our main concerns), but she was able to accommodate our exit extremely well. Many Airbnb hosts simply rent out a room, but Kathleen goes above and beyond to make sure the stay was special. She had tidied a bed for us, laid out some snacks, and showed us where everything in her house was for easy access. She made sure we were comfortable, which is something I appreciate in a host. She was also very easy to get along with.<br><br>Her house itself was very nicely designed and I thoroughly enjoyed being in that space. It was easy to settle into and she made sure everything is great for her guests. If you're looking for a place in the area, I'm sure Kathleen would be the best option. You won't regret it.",

If you played your cards right though, it would only be $8 overnight which was still way cheaper than what we had paid before at Waikiki. Make sure you get food before you head back in for the night as well, considering a majority of the places within walking distance close really early- like 6 pm.

The kitchen was nicely stocked with a few pans and even spices (though we brought our own). We did not see the host, however we did see some of the other guests that were staying in different rooms. We were able to come and go as we pleased. The only notable discrepancy I had was the plumbing. The shower would sometimes shut off while in use.

But all 3 bedrooms were comfortably decorated. The location was in a great part of town at the end of the drive.  A beautiful, thick wooded area looms beyond the back patio and expansive yard. Having left my TX home in a drought w/threat of wildfires, I was most excited on the evenings I could leave the window raised by my bedside to hear the rain and night sounds.\n<br>\n<br>The house was exceptionally clean and had every house appliance, spice, etc you could ever need.

The location is super close to downtown and easy to get about Lafayette. BUT the biggest asset here is our host, Jason. He is friendly, helpful, very responsive, and overall a fantastic host. He also knows the city quite well if you need a recommendation, is a professional photog, and a musician (He's probably got more skills but we were only there two nights).

It\u2019s minutes from the beach and a short walk to Waikiki or Ft DeRussy beach, or easy bus ride to further sights (e.g., Iolani Palace, Diamonds Head).  As a bachelor suite, the room itself was the perfect size for a couple looking to explore Honolulu. Inside, the d\u00e9cor is pretty and modern and makes a nice private place to relax after a long day of adventure.  Though we didn't get a chance to use the pool (we were too busy exploring Honolulu), it looked well maintained and like a great place to relax.  Outside, the building itself, which is both a hotel and condo buildling, is a bit dated. However, the staff are very friendly, and someone is always around \u2013 night or day - to help you in case your key card doesn\u2019t work.  Dana was also a great host, and communication with her was quick and easy!   ",

It was a straight up rate.<br><br>Bill is a straight up man of integrity. This is what made my stay so wonderful. <br><br>I have stayed at many hostels around the world with similar rates, but you have to put up with a lot more crap, such as kitchens that are dirty, missing appliances, using a nasty dormitory room with snoring, and clothes around the floor, and there have been many other guests who are both well-mannered and ill-mannered. I also include the hostel staff in this smorgasbord. I also used Couchsurfing some years ago, and I met a few marvelous people through it, but lately the site, and the people running it have messed up its system. AirBnB has taken the slack and created a new way to visit new places - and it has marvelous gems like Bill's place in Globe.",

		"text": "We had a fantastic one night stay at Plantation Mouton Bois Des Chenes enroute to New Orleans. We stayed in the Carriage House which was clean, comfy and had good WiFi. Ravi greeted us with wine and delicious cookies fresh out of the oven and John cooked us up a stellar breakfast feast the next day (fruit salad, crab omelette, jalapeno sausage and biscuits). Loved having a tour of the house and getting John's run down on the area. Highly recommended (don't forget to get the breakfast)!",
